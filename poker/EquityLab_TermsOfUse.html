<h2>2. Subscriptions and In-App Purchases</h2>

<h3>2.1. General</h3>

<p>The App may offer additional premium features accessible via subscriptions or one-time in-app purchases (“Premium Features”). Payments are processed by Apple through the App Store / StoreKit. We do not handle your payment card details directly.</p>

<h3>2.4. Changes to pricing and features</h3>

<p>We may change the pricing, duration, or content of Premium Features at any time. If prices change, we will follow the App Store’s procedures for notifying you. Your continued use of Premium Features after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>

<p>Any feedback, ideas, or suggestions you provide may be used by us without any obligation to compensate you.</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. No Real-Money Gambling</h2>

<hr>

<h2>6. Disclaimers</h2>

<h3>6.1. No guarantee of results</h3>

<p>Poker and other card games involve variance and uncertainty. The App may provide calculations, simulations, and strategy insights, but it does <strong>not</strong> guarantee any financial or performance outcomes and does <strong>not</strong> ensure that any particular strategy will be profitable or successful.</p>

<p>You use the App entirely at your own risk.</p>

<h3>6.2. “As is”</h3>

<p>The App is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Warranties of merchantability,</li>
    <li>Fitness for a particular purpose,</li>
    <li>Non-infringement, or</li>
    <li>Availability or reliability of the App.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not warrant that the App will be error-free, secure, or uninterrupted.</p>

<hr>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,</li>
    <li>Loss of profits or revenues,</li>
    <li>Loss of data,</li>
    <li>Business interruption,</li>
</ul>

<p>arising out of or in connection with your use of or inability to use the App, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

<p>To the extent any liability exists despite the foregoing, our total aggregate liability arising out of or relating to the App shall not exceed the amount you paid (if any) for using the App in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>

<hr>

<h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>The App may use or integrate with third-party services (such as analytics, crash reporting, or subscription validation) as necessary to provide core functionality and improve quality.</p>

<p>Your use of these services may be subject to their own terms and policies. We are not responsible for third-party services or content.</p>

<hr>

<h2>9. Changes to the App</h2>

<p>We may update, modify, or discontinue parts of the App at any time, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Adding or removing features,</li>
    <li>Changing or discontinuing Premium Features,</li>
    <li>Releasing new versions or updates.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are not obligated to maintain any particular feature or level of service.</p>

<hr>

<h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>

<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this document.</p>

<p>If you continue to use the App after changes take effect, you agree to the revised Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the App.</p>

<hr>

<h2>11. Termination</h2>

<p>You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it from your device.</p>

<p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App, or any part of it, if we reasonably believe that you have violated these Terms, or if we decide to discontinue the App.</p>

<p>Sections that by their nature should survive termination (such as intellectual property, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and third-party service provisions) will continue to apply after termination.</p>
