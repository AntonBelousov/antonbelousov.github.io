</head>
<body>
<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 11 Dec 2025</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Equity Lab application (the “App”) handles information.</p>

<p>The App is designed as an offline poker equity calculator and training tool. It does <strong>not</strong> provide or support real-money gambling.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Data Controller</h2>

<p>The App is provided by an individual developer:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> Anton Belousov</li>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:avbtouch@gmail.com">avbtouch@gmail.com</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>2. Scope</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Equity Lab iOS/macOS application</li>
    <li>Any in-app functionality for subscriptions, settings, and user preferences</li>
</ul>

<p>It does <strong>not</strong> cover any third-party websites or services that may be linked from the App.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>The App is primarily designed to run <strong>locally on your device</strong> and does not require account registration.</p>

<p>Depending on your configuration and platform settings, we may process the following categories of data:</p>

<h3>3.1. Data you provide</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In-app configuration and preferences (for example: saved ranges, custom settings, training configuration)</li>
    <li>Subscription-related parameters (for example: which plan you selected)</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> and is used only to provide the App’s functionality.</p>

<h3>3.2. Purchase and subscription data</h3>

<p>If you purchase a subscription or other in-app products, the transaction is processed by Apple via App Store / StoreKit. We do not receive your full payment details (such as card number).</p>

<p>We may have access to limited information provided by Apple for the purposes of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Validating your purchase or subscription status</li>
    <li>Enabling or disabling premium features in the App</li>
</ul>

<p>This information may include an anonymized identifier, product identifier, and subscription status (active, expired, and similar).</p>

<h3>3.3. Analytics and diagnostics (if enabled)</h3>

<p>The App itself does not require analytics to function. However, we may use privacy-friendly analytics or crash-reporting tools (for example, via Apple or other providers) to understand usage patterns and improve stability.</p>

<p>This typically includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>App version and device model</li>
    <li>Operating system version</li>
    <li>Anonymous usage events (for example, feature usage counts)</li>
    <li>Crash logs</li>
</ul>

<p>We do <strong>not</strong> attempt to identify you personally based on this information.</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>

<p>We use information only for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To operate and improve the App</li>
    <li>To manage subscriptions and unlock premium features</li>
    <li>To fix bugs and improve stability</li>
    <li>To respond to user support requests</li>
</ul>

<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data.</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. Legal Basis (where applicable)</h2>

<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, our legal bases for processing data may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong>: to provide you with the App and its features, including subscriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: to improve the App, prevent abuse, and secure our services.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance with legal obligations</strong>: where we are required to keep certain records for tax, accounting, or legal reasons.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>6. Data Storage and Retention</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Most App data (such as saved ranges and preferences) is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> and is under your control.</li>
    <li>Subscription status information retrieved from Apple is stored only as long as necessary to validate your access to premium features.</li>
    <li>If analytics or crash reporting is used, data retention periods depend on the respective provider’s policies. We aim to keep data only as long as needed for diagnostics and improvement.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can delete local App data at any time by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Removing saved ranges and preferences from within the App (where applicable), or</li>
    <li>Deleting the App from your device (this removes all local data associated with the App).</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>7. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>

<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or rent your data.</p>

<p>We may share limited data with:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Apple (App Store / StoreKit)</strong><br>
        To process purchases and subscriptions and to validate receipts and subscription status.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Analytics or crash reporting providers (if integrated)</strong><br>
        To analyze usage and improve stability.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Any such providers act as data processors on our behalf where applicable, and we aim to choose providers with strong privacy practices.</p>

<p>We may also disclose information if required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to protect our rights, property, or safety.</p>

<hr>

<h2>8. International Transfers</h2>

<p>If any third-party services used by the App process data outside your country, this may involve international data transfers. Where applicable, we will rely on appropriate safeguards (such as standard contractual clauses) to protect your data.</p>

<hr>

<h2>9. Your Rights</h2>

<p>Your rights depend on your jurisdiction, but may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The right to access the information we process about you</li>
    <li>The right to correct inaccurate information</li>
    <li>The right to delete certain data</li>
    <li>The right to object to or restrict certain processing</li>
    <li>The right to data portability</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the App stores most data locally on your device, you usually control it directly (by editing or deleting it, or uninstalling the App).</p>

<p>If you want to exercise any privacy-related rights that require our involvement, please contact us at <a href="mailto:avbtouch@gmail.com">avbtouch@gmail.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.</p>

<hr>

<h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>The App is intended for use by adults who study poker strategy. It is <strong>not</strong> directed to children under the age required by local law to give valid consent on their own.</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

<hr>

<h2>11. Real-Money Gambling Disclaimer</h2>

<p>The App is a <strong>training and calculation tool only</strong>. It does not:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Offer real-money gambling,</li>
    <li>Provide a platform to place real bets, or</li>
    <li>Handle deposits or withdrawals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any use of the App to study or analyze strategies for poker or other games is entirely your responsibility and must comply with the laws and regulations of your jurisdiction.</p>

<hr>

<h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this document.</p>

<p>In case of material changes, we may also provide a notice in the App or via other reasonable means.</p>
