  <h1>Terms of Use for Iconic Asset Studio</h1>
  <p class="meta">Last updated: 11 December 2025</p>

  <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully before using the <strong>Iconic Asset Studio</strong> application (the "App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

  <p>These Terms are a legal agreement between you and Anton Belousov ("we", "us", or "our").</p>

  <h2>1. License</h2>
  <p>1.1. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the App on devices you own or control, solely for the purpose of generating application icon assets and related image files.</p>
  <p>1.2. You may not distribute, rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the App or any portion of it to any third party, except as permitted by Apple’s App Store terms and conditions.</p>

  <h2>2. Restrictions</h2>
  <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the App, except to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law;</li>
    <li>Modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works based on the App;</li>
    <li>Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices (including copyright and trademark notices) on or within the App;</li>
    <li>Use the App in any manner that violates any applicable law or regulation;</li>
    <li>Use the App to infringe the rights of any third party, including intellectual property and privacy rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Ownership and Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>3.1. The App, including all software, graphics, user interface, and documentation, is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.</p>
  <p>3.2. These Terms do not grant you any ownership interest in the App. All rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved by us.</p>
  <p>3.3. You retain all rights to the images and content that you provide to the App as input, as well as to the output icon files generated by the App, subject to the rights of any third parties whose materials you use.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Software and Services</h2>
  <p>4.1. The App may use or include third-party libraries or frameworks that are licensed under their own terms. Any such third-party components are provided to you under the applicable license terms of the respective third parties.</p>
  <p>4.2. The App itself does not require you to create an account or connect to external online services. However, your use of the App is subject to Apple’s App Store and operating system terms, which are independent from these Terms.</p>

  <h2>5. No Professional Advice</h2>
  <p>The App is provided as a utility tool to help you generate app icon assets. It does not constitute legal, design, or professional advice. You are solely responsible for ensuring that any assets you generate comply with the guidelines and requirements of Apple, other platforms, and applicable law.</p>

  <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
  <p>WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. YOUR USE OF THE APP IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.</p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
  <p>OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE APP OR THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE APP (IF ANY), OR ONE U.S. DOLLAR (USD 1), WHICHEVER IS GREATER.</p>

  <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of any third-party rights.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to the App and to These Terms</h2>
  <p>9.1. We may update or modify the App from time to time, including by adding, changing, or removing features.</p>
  <p>9.2. We may modify these Terms at any time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after the effective date of the revised Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop using the App.</p>

  <h2>10. Termination</h2>
  <p>10.1. These Terms are effective until terminated by you or by us.</p>
  <p>10.2. We may terminate or suspend your license to use the App at any time, without notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms or if we discontinue the App.</p>
  <p>10.3. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the App and delete all copies of it from your devices. Sections that by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 6, 7, and 8.</p>
