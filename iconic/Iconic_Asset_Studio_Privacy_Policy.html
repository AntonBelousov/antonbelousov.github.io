  <h1>Privacy Policy for Iconic Asset Studio</h1>
  <p class="meta">Last updated: 11 December 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Iconic Asset Studio</strong> (the "App") handles information when you use it. The App is provided by Anton Belousov ("we", "us", or "our").</p>

  <p>We are committed to respecting your privacy and keeping your data safe.</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>Iconic Asset Studio is a local utility for generating application icon assets from an image. The App is designed to work primarily on your device, without requiring an account or continuous internet connection.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>When you use the App, we do not collect or store any of the following types of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name, email address, or other contact details;</li>
    <li>Your payment information (these are handled by Apple, not by the App);</li>
    <li>The images you open, drag and drop, or generate inside the App;</li>
    <li>The icon files and asset catalogs you export.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All images and generated files stay on your device unless you choose to share or move them yourself.</p>

  <h2>3. Technical and Diagnostic Data</h2>
  <p>3.1. The App itself does not actively send analytics or tracking data to our own servers.</p>
  <p>3.2. However, Apple and the operating system may collect certain technical data automatically, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device model and operating system version;</li>
    <li>Anonymous crash reports and performance data;</li>
    <li>Other diagnostic information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is processed according to Apple’s own privacy policies and developer tools. We may receive aggregated crash reports or diagnostics from Apple to help us improve stability and performance, but we do not receive information that directly identifies you.</p>

  <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>To the extent we receive anonymous crash reports or diagnostic data from Apple, we may use this information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fix bugs and improve app stability;</li>
    <li>Optimize performance and compatibility with different devices and system versions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use this information for advertising, profiling, or tracking individual users.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>5.1. The App does not integrate third-party analytics SDKs, advertising frameworks, or social media plugins.</p>
  <p>5.2. Any purchase you make through the App Store is processed by Apple. We do not have access to your full payment details.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We do not store your personal data on our own servers. Any diagnostic information we receive through Apple’s systems is retained according to Apple’s policies and the settings of our developer account.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps to address the issue.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>Because the App does not collect personal data directly, there is no account to delete and no in-app personal profile. You can control whether to share crash logs and diagnostic data with developers in your device’s system settings, as provided by Apple.</p>
  <p>If at any time you wish to stop using the App, you can delete it from your device. This will remove the App and its local data, but may not remove diagnostic reports already shared with Apple.</p>

  <h2>9. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect the App’s integrity and any limited diagnostic information we receive. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after changes are made indicates your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
  <p>If you do not agree with the updated Privacy Policy, you should stop using the App and delete it from your device.</p>

  <h2>11. Contact</h2>
